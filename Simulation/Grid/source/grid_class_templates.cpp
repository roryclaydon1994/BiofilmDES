    The software is based on algorithms described in:

    Mechanically driven growth of quasi-two dimensional microbial colonies,
    F.D.C. Farrell, O. Hallatschek, D. Marenduzzo, B. Waclaw,
    Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 168101 (2013).

    Three-dimensional distinct element simulation of spherocylinder crystallization.
    Pournin, L., Weber, M., Tsukahara, M. et al.
    Granul. Matter 7, 119–126 (2005).

    A fast algorithm to evaluate the shortest distance between rods,
    C. Vega, S. Lago,
    Comput. Chem., 18(1), 55-59 (1994)

    I would like to thank Bartlomiej Waclaw from Edinburgh University for some
    very useful discussions on algorithm stability, timestep choice and some
    potential optimisations to try out in future.
